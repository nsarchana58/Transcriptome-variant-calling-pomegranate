# Transcriptome-Wide Variant Calling in "Punica granatum"

This project was completed as part of my Master's in Bioinformatics at Garden City University Bangalore.

## Overview

- Used RNA-Seq data (NCBI PRJNA952822) for variant calling and RNA editing analysis
- Tools used: FastQC, Trimmomatic, HISAT2, GATK HaplotypeCaller, REDItools2, SnpEff, VCFtools, Blast2GO
- Focused on identifying SNPs, Indels, and RNA editing sites like A-to-I and C-to-U in P. granatum
- Functional annotation and diversity analysis

## Results

- 116,683 variants detected
- 32,716 genes affected
- 5,069 high-impact variants
- Multiple RNA editing candidates found
- Functional annotations using Gene Ontology and EC numbers
